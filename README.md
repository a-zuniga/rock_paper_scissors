# Introduction
This is a small rock, paper, scissors game written in vanilla javascript! 

# Production warning
This program relies on alerts and prompts for user input. If you have these disabled in your browser settings, you will not be able to play!

# Not fully tested, expect bugs!
I have not written tests for game.js so you might experience some unexpected results. 

# Contributing
I am hoping to add a front end and make gameplay smoother. Feel free to check for issues on this repo and pull in your changes!
Any and all help is gladly appreciated ðŸ˜Š
